# SpaceStation-OldUnity

My prototype first-person voxel multiplayer space game, ported to the Oculus Go as an experiment (made in Unity 2019.1).

To run this project, you will need to own an Oculus Go and set up a dev environment.

You may not use any of the code or assets. Do not modify the code or send any pull requests. Please see the license file for more information.
